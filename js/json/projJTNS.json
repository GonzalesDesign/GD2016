Client wanted to create multiple sites and required the ability to update the site for content. I built the site using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The development code is actually written in ES2015, SCSS, Babel, Webpack and NodeJS. I wrote the template with ES2015 pulling content from JSON files which the client can update. I used Webpack and Babel to transpiled the ES6 codes to ES5, gave it to the client and uploaded in their web server. <a href = 'https://github.com/GonzalesDesign/JillTuckerNursingServices'  target = '_blank'>My github repo for this project.</a>",
